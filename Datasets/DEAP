DEAP (Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals) is a database for emotion analysis utilizing physiological signals. 
It comprises physiological data and emotion ratings from multiple participants while watching various music video clips. 
The DEAP dataset was collected in a laboratory setting with the aim of investigating the correlation between emotions and physiological signals.

Below is a detailed introduction to the DEAP dataset:
(1) Data Collection Process: Participants wore physiological sensor devices, including electrodes for measuring 
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, electrodermal activity (EDA) signals, and
electromyogram (EMG) signals. Participants were asked to watch 40 5-minute music video clips and provide emotion 
ratings during the viewing period.
(2) Physiological Signals: The DEAP dataset comprises physiological signal data from 32 channels. 
This includes 14 electroencephalogram (EEG) signals sampled at 128Hz, 1 electrocardiogram (ECG) signal sampled
at 256Hz, 8 electrodermal activity (EDA) signals sampled at 4Hz, 4 electromyogram (EMG) signals sampled at 128Hz, 
and 1 respiration signal sampled at 32Hz.
(3) Emotion Ratings: After viewing each music video clip, participants rated their emotional experiences on a 
discrete 9-point scale. These emotions include pleasure, excitement, anger, stress, sadness, fear, 
surprise, calmness, and boredom.
