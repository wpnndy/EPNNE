The SEED-IV is an evolution of the original SEED dataset.  The number of categories of emotions changes to four: 
happy, sad, fear, and neutral. In SEED-IV, we provide not only EEG signals but also eye movement features recorded 
by SMI eye-tracking glasses, which makes it a well-formed multimodal dataset for emotion recognition.  

Seventy-two film clips were carefully chosen by a preliminary study, which had the tendency to induce happiness, 
sadness, fear or neutral emotions. A total of 15 subjects participated in the experiment. For each participant, 
3 sessions were performed on different days, and each session contained 24 trials. In one trial, the participant 
watched one of the film clips, while his or her EEG signals and eye movements were collected with the 62-channel 
ESI NeuroScan System and SMI eye-tracking glasses.
