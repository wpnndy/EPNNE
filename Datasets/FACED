The proposed Finer-grained Affective Computing EEG Dataset (FACED) aimed to address issues by recording 32-channel 
EEG signals from 123 subjects. During the experiment, subjects watched 28 emotion-elicitation video clips covering 
nine emotion categories (amusement, inspiration, joy, tenderness; anger, fear, disgust, sadness, and neutral emotion),
providing a fine-grained and balanced categorization on both the positive and negative sides of emotion. 
The FACED dataset is expected to contribute to developing EEG-based affective computing algorithms for real-world 
applications.
