The SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED) dataset was developed by the Research Center for Brain Computing and Machine Intelligence (BCMI) at 
Shanghai Jiaotong University. The dataset is designed based on the EEG emotion classification task. 
The dataset recorded EEG signals from 15 subjects as they watched positive, neutral, and negative emotional 
movie clips, each of which lasted 3-5 minutes. The collection was repeated for three days for each participant, 
with an interval of about a week. The SEED dataset was recorded using a 62-channel ESI NeuroScan device at a 
sampling rate of 1 kHz, then downsampled to 200Hz and a 0-75Hz bandpass filter was used to remove artifacts from 
the EEG signal data.
