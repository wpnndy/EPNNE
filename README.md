# Introduction

Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely utilized in emotion recognition due to its high temporal resolution and reliability. However, the individual differences and non-stationary characteristics of EEG, along with the complexity and variability of emotions, pose challenges in generalizing emotion recognition models across subjects. In this paper, an end-to-end framework is proposed to improve the performance of cross-subject emotion recognition. A novel evolutionary programming (EP)-based optimization strategy with neural network (NN) as the base classifier termed NN ensemble with EP (EPNNE) is designed for cross-subject emotion recognition. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the publicly available DEAP, FACED, SEED, and SEED-IV datasets.
